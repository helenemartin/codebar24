Intertitles 

MVP initiated at Codebar Session on a 24th of August 2018

“You have the right to remain silent”

Within the last five years, I have been interested in exploring the intersections between poetry and computation. I have been prototyping an MVP on Rails that generates intertitles using the speech to text and speech synthesis API generating animated text sequences.

An intertitle is a piece of filmed, printed text edited into the midst of the action at various points in motion pictures). In my wildest dreams, I was developing the artificial intelligence that can turn brain activity into text, a subject matter currently being developed by researchers at the University of California to aid communication for patients who are unable to speak or type, such as those in locked-in syndrome. My MVP is functional but the code is very convoluted, I overlooked the design and user journey as I don’t have users! I designed a prototype for a Dada poetry experimental tool, with a speech to text functionality (The software is on at night, in case I speak during my sleep). At this level, the app operates as an exclusive CMS: I am the sole user and administrator. After going through authentication, I can create my intertitle via an online form that records my speech. Once satisfied with my text, I can give it a title, save it on the PostgreSQL database, edit, destroy as the app has a CRUD interface. The text is then transformed as an animated text sequence on the front end. A speaker icon gives the option to read the text, on-click to hear it without seeing the text
